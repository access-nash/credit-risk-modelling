Credit risk modelling - Building a PD, LGD and EAD model using loans data 

Part I: data cleaning from original data set, choosing variables for building PD model and estimation ; 
Part II: Out-of-sample PD model validation, creating score cards from PD model and setting cut-offs for approval/rejection
Part III: Continuing from the PD model in the previous section to build the LGD and the EAD models and finally calculating the Expected loss for the loan portfolio
